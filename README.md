`github-runner` provides the Github Actions [self-hosted](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners) [runner](https://github.com/actions/runner) as a container image that registers itself with Github.

## Features

* Minimalist, runners register themselves (no controller, no CRDs)
* Acts as a Github App to generate registration tokens
* Add [org-level](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/adding-self-hosted-runners#adding-a-self-hosted-runner-to-an-organization) runners
* Use `github-runner` as a base image to customize
  * Install languages needed for Github Workflows
  * Add tools needed for Github Workflows
* Deregisters runner when the container/pod exits

## Background

Github [self-hosted runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners) allow you to run Github Actions Workflows in environments you manage on your own infrastructure. Github allows runners to be registered using short-lived registration tokens, but leaves this to other systems.

`github-runner` packages the Github [runner](https://github.com/actions/runner) along with a tool to fetch a runner registration token dynamically on container start by acting as a Github App. On Kubernetes, you can create a Deployment of `github-runner` (or descendant image) Pods, watch them register and run jobs as long as you need them, and roll out updates when you need to update (e.g. new tooling).

*Note: Github personal access tokens can also fetch runner registration tokens, but at most organizations, using a personal token or a robot user isn't an option.*

## Usage

Create a Github App for your account or organization. Use the links below to pre-fill fields where possible. Be sure to choose a unique app name (e.g. org-name/github-runner).

* [Github App for your account](https://github.com/settings/apps/new?url=http://github.com/poseidon/github-runner&webhook_active=false&public=false&organization_self_hosted_runners=write)
* [Github App for your Organization](https://github.com/organizations/:org/settings/apps/new?url=http://github.com/poseidon/github-runner&webhook_active=false&public=false&organization_self_hosted_runners=write)

Organization Permissions:

* Self-hosted runners (read/write)

Note the **App ID**.

Next, generate a **private key**.

Finally, install your private Github App into your user or organization.

Note the **Install ID** found at the end of the URL.

* https://github.com/settings/installations/INSTALL_ID
* https://github.com/organizations/ORG/settings/installations/INSTALL_ID

Create a Kubernetes Deployment (or similar definition) to run the [`quay.io/poseidon/github-runner`](https://quay.io/repository/poseidon/github-runner?tab=tags) (or derivative) container image with the following required environment variables (see [configuration](#configuration)):

* `GH_APP_ID`
* `GH_APP_KEY_PATH`
* `GH_INSTALL_ID`
* `GH_ORG`

Typically `GH_APP_KEY_PATH` would be a path to a mounted Kubernetes Secret.

Finally, check that the runner(s) registered as [Org Runners](https://github.com/organizations/ORG/settings/actions/runners) with Github.

### Configuration

Configure github-runner to act as a Github App to obtain a self-hosted runner registration token.

| env variable    | description |
|-----------------|---------------|
| GH_APP_ID       | Github App ID |
| GH_APP_KEY_PATH | Path to Github App key .pem |
| GH_INSTALL_ID   | Github Installation ID |
| GH_ORG          | Github organization name |
| GROUP  | Runner group defaults to default |
| LABELS | Labels in addition to default: 'self-hosted,Linux,X64' |

## Tradeoffs

`github-runner` is minimalist and low maintenance.

* Runners registers themselves to Github (no controllers, CRDs, etc.)
* Manage runners using ordinary Kubernetes manifests
* Scale by scaling replicas (e.g. Kubernetes Deployment)
* Customize by using `github-runner` as a base image (e.g. `FROM`)

More complex needs may be handled by more complex [projects](https://github.com/actions-runner-controller/actions-runner-controller) (out of scope):

* Auto-scaling in runners
* Ephemeral runners

## Security

Github recommends [self-hosted runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/about-self-hosted-runners#self-hosted-runner-security) should only be used with private repositories at your own organization. Additionally, `github-runner` allows runners to conveniently register themselves by acting as a Github App, meaning it may be possible for a workload to obtain the same Github App permissions (which allow managing self-hosted workers). For our use internal cases this is fine.
